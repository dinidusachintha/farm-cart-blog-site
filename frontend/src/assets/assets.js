            Farmers use GPS Global Positioning System and GIS Geographic Information System to create detailed maps of their fields. This allows for precise planting, fertilizing, and harvesting, leading to better yields and reduced input costs.

            <p>GIS helps farmers optimize the use of inputs (such as water, fertilizers, pesticides) based on precise field conditions. By mapping soil characteristics, weather patterns, and crop performance, farmers can target areas needing specific treatments, reducing waste and improving crop yields.
